                            <p>Hello. First, could you briefly introduce yourself, including how long you've lived or worked in Hunter Point?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>I just moved into 1qps 9 months ago, but I've been staying here intermittently since 2020.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>OK, can you talk about the significant changes you've observed in Hunter Point over these years?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>I feel the landscaping near the riverside has been improving. However, for the Court Square and Queens Plaza area, it seems there are fewer public spaces and it's not as livable as before. There are more construction sites for new apartments, which is very noisy. Although there was construction from 2020-2023, it didn't feel as dense and frequent, possibly due to the pandemic, and the population density didn't feel as high as now.</p>
                            <p>In recent years, especially 2024-2025, particularly 2024, it seems more people with more money are willing to live near the river. Except for the inconvenient public transportation which can't be controlled, the living environment is much better. Also, many new businesses, food and dessert shops have moved toward the riverside.</p>
                            <p>Compared to previous years, there are more grocery store options now, you can buy groceries from various countries like China, Japan, Korea, and America without leaving Hunters Point. It's much more convenient compared to previous years when we had to go to Manhattan for shopping and return home.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>OK, I've actually lived both on Main Street and now live by the riverside, and I clearly feel the riverside is much more comfortable. The Main Street area has buildings so densely packed, there's hardly any difference from Manhattan. So as a rental agent, do you think in the next 5 years, Hunter Point community will develop a clear distinction between a "high-end riverside area" and a "densely developed area"?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>I think it's possible. From my experience as a rental agent, the popular high-rise luxury apartments near the river are mostly under TFC, and considering Avalon and Gotham on the westernmost corner, I believe given these developers' preferences and current planning, there probably won't be more new developments possible nearby, nor is there enough land for planning, unless they reduce the park's public areas and push the residential area westward. But I remember seeing news about LIC planning that emphasized preserving the riverside public areas, so I think that's unlikely.</p>
                            <p>Although I live near Queens Plaza, I love walking to the riverside, and I've noticed that the riverside area's commercial facilities tend to be more boutique and leisure-oriented, with upscale restaurants, specialty cafes, and premium supermarkets. For instance, I once passed by a Japanese supermarket called Mogmog - initially, I thought it would be like Koufuku, a typical Asian supermarket, but it turned out to sell expensive Japanese groceries and high-end sashimi. Including some mid to high-end restaurants I know of that are relatively quiet and elegant, suitable for dates - they clearly choose locations near the river, avoiding the most densely populated Queens Plaza area.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>Oh, I also feel that riverside supermarkets are considerably more expensive in both prices and products compared to the Main Street area. So how do you think this formation of a "high-end riverside area" will affect neighborhood relationships? For example, will there be obvious community segregation or reduced interaction between different income groups?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>If you frequently visit the riverside for walks, you'll notice most people there are dressed casually but more elegantly, walking dogs, reading, or having picnics. It feels more like a bourgeois lifestyle. People might chat casually if they're sitting on the same bench or just passing by. The overall vibe feels more chill and relaxed.</p>
                            <p>The Queens Plaza area clearly feels much busier - you can tell from the number of subway commuters. Queens Plaza, Court Square, and Queensboro Plaza stations have at least double the rush hour traffic compared to Hunter Point and Vernon Blvd. Looking at restaurants, establishments in the Queens Plaza area have more delivery service partnerships posted at their entrances compared to riverside locations, and there are more fast food and food cart options. I personally think this is not only due to population density and concentration of Chinese international students but also because people's life rhythms are faster, with more students and office workers.</p>
                            <p>I think this might create some community separation. Riverside residents might focus more on their small social circles, while people in high-density areas are more focused on commuting and work, leading to less interaction between the two groups. However, this might also lead to the formation of distinct community cultures, with high-end leisure and young commuter groups each developing their own lifestyles.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>So based on the community differentiation trend you described, where do you think the government and developers will tend to invest more resources?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>I'm not sure, but I hope they'll invest more in the Queens Plaza area, especially in adding more green spaces, though it seems unlikely since available space is already very limited. It seems developers will try to build as many buildings as possible. You can see the trend where old houses on Main Street, the shorter buildings, are all being demolished to build at least 15-20 story buildings.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>From your perspective, what are the problems in the entire area?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>I think the biggest problem in Hunters Point currently is public transportation. For example, the metro lines are confusing, and because some parts are above ground and some underground, it creates a lot of noise. While the riverside is quiet, it's too far from the subway, especially if you live somewhere like Gotham Points.</p>

                            <p>Indeed, only the 7 train provides access to Manhattan from the riverside. What kind of transportation solutions do you think might emerge in the future?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>I've noticed that Citibike stations are gradually increasing, but the areas with comfortable bike lanes are already accessible by subway or walking. Towards the riverside, there are many traffic lights, fewer stations, narrow roads, and no dedicated bike lanes - it almost feels better to walk. Including living by the river or even getting to Manhattan, public transportation options are quite limited, and on weekends you even need to take detours.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>Indeed, I strongly relate to this aspect. Let's discuss some future questions. How do you think real estate prices will perform in these two areas over the next 5 years?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>I think there might be a divergence. Regarding real estate prices, I can only judge based on my knowledge of luxury apartments. Apartment rentals will all increase - from what I know, studio and 1B1B prices in Hunters Point are already similar to or even higher than Manhattan apartments of the same size and height, even more luxurious ones. The prices are inflated, but many people are still eager to rent.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>Yea, my current rent is basically the same as downtown Manhattan. But despite this, I still prefer living by the river, I feel the environment is better than on the island and quieter. OK, last question, do you think the riverside has other advantages? Is this trend sustainable?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Interviewee:</div>
                            <p>The community is relatively safer than some areas in Manhattan, given the concentration of luxury buildings and good area management. Plus, there's the international student community effect. More and more Chinese businesses are opening in this area.</p>
                            <p>For the next 5-10 years, it's hard to judge. On the positive side, this community effect could drive local economic development, especially attracting more Chinese international students and businesses, like specialty restaurants, supermarkets, bubble tea shops, etc., which also provides convenience for local residents.</p>

                            <p>This is my third interview, which went well compared to the previous two.</p>
                            
                            <p>The person interviewed is a friend of a friend of mine. She is also a Chinese student who has become a professional housing agent. When I interviewed her in Chinese, I found that it was much smoother, and the flexibility and extensibility of my questions were also improved.</p>
                            
                            <p>I was quite satisfied with the whole interview, and I think the harvest I got was obviously more than the previous two interviews. She gives a perspective of both short and long term rentals, and because of professional reasons, she is obviously familiar with the luxury building here, as well as the distribution between communities and so on.</p>
                            
                            <p>We talked about other things at the same time, and I think I chose the right person this time, because she was very talkative, so basically I didn't have to say much, I just listened and asked the appropriate questions.</p>
