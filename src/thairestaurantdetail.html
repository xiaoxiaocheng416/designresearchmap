                            <div class="interviewee">Staff:</div>
                            <p>In here is like two years.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>Can you share what dishes customers order most? Like what dishes they usually order?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Staff:</div>
                            <p>The dishes they usually order is the overrized section, the grapael which is your choice of protein with the basil sauce. And then atomium also from the special one, we have the whole fit. That one also people like to order a lot. Also the Cowsoy which is like noodle curry with choice of beef or chicken.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>How much do customers typically know about Thai food? Like do they ask for recommendations or do they already know what they want?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Staff:</div>
                            <p>It's pretty mixed. Some people come in and they already know exactly what they want, like they don't even look at the menu. But then we get a lot of customers who are not really familiar with Thai food, they just know like Pad Thai, so they ask us what's good here, what's popular. We try to recommend things based on what they like - spicy or not spicy. Sometimes people think they want really spicy but then they can't handle our Thai spicy level, so we have to be careful with that. But yeah, I would say maybe half the people ask for recommendations.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>Moving on to the community questions, since you've been working here, have you noticed any changes in the clientele? What kind of clients from which countries have changed?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Staff:</div>
                            <p>Yeah, recently we got a lot of Chinese or Asian customers - Korean, Japanese, but mostly Chinese people. In the past, it was usually American.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>When did you notice that shift from American to Asian customers?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Staff:</div>
                            <p>I think it started maybe one year ago. We started to see more Asian customers coming in, especially on the weekends. I think maybe there were some reviews online or something in Chinese websites or apps, because sometimes they show us their phones with the dishes names in Chinese characters. So yeah, it's been a while.</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewer">Interviewer:</div>
                            <p>Do you think that's a positive thing for the restaurant and the community?</p>
                            
                            <div class="interviewee">Staff:</div>
                            <p>Yeah, I think it's definitely positive for us because the Asian customers appreciate the more authentic dishes, so we can serve more variety of things. For the community, I think it's good too. Also they tend to come in groups which is good for us, and they take pictures of the food and share online so we get more exposure that way. So yeah, I think it's a positive change overall.</p>

                            <div class="interviewee">Staff:</div>
                            <p>Yeah, just like couple restaurants, couple places around here come and go. But we've only been here like two years so I didn't see much different.</p>

                            <p>This is my second interview and it definitely went better than my first one. I went to a Thai restaurant with my friends, which helped create a more relaxed atmosphere. After ordering, I told the waiter I was a college student looking to interview people about neighborhood restaurants. We agreed to chat at the bar after dinner.</p>
                            
                            <p>I think I picked a good time. It was around 3pm when the restaurant wasn't too crowded. Looking back though, there's still room for improvement. The interview only lasted about 5 minutes, which wasn't long enough for what we need.</p>
                            
                            <p>There were a few reasons for this. I skipped some questions during the interview because I felt they weren't very good. This could have been avoided if I had done what we practice in class. Thinking about these questions from the interviewee's perspective first.</p>
                            
                            <p>My friend gave me some good feedback on our way back. She pointed out that each of my questions could have branched into several smaller follow-up questions. Like when I asked the waiter about which community he worked in before, I could have asked how that community felt different from this one.</p>
                            
                            <p>Overall, I felt much more comfortable this time, especially with my friends there. It was definitely an improvement from my first interview, but I can see how to make the next one even better.</p>
